    ALGORITHM : compare each element of array and fine the largest element and smallest element
	
	===================================
	INPUT : array with number elements

	PROCESSING STEPS : suppose the first one as the largest and compare to each element of array
	                   if other one is bigger than current largest value, the current largest value will be change
					   suppose the first one as the smallest and compare to each element of array
	                   if other one is samller than current smallest value, the current smallest value will be change

	OUTPUTS : largest number and smallest number

	=================================
	PSEUDOCODE : Initialize int largestNum to zero
				 Initialize int smallestNum to zero
				 
				 Find_largest_element
				 Set largest_element to array(0)
				 DO index = 1 to number_of_elements
                 FOR loop-index = 0 and until loop-index is less than the length of array and loop-index increment by 1
				 each time
				   IF current largest value is less than loop-index 
				      Change the largest value to the loop-index
				 ENDDO
				 Print largest_element
				 END

				 Find_smallest_element
				 Set smallest_element to array(0)
				 DO index = 1 to number_of_elements
				 FOR loop-index = 0 and until loop-index is less than the length of array and loop-index increment by 1
				 each time
				   IF current smallest value is greater than loop-index 
				      Change the smallest value to the loop-index
				 ENDDO
				 Print largest_element
				 END
