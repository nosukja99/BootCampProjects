    ALGORITHM :  read the electricity usage file and produce an electricity usage report and calculate amount owing
	             owingAmount is calculated at 11 cnets for each kilowatt hour up to 200 and 8 cnets for each over 200
	===================================
	INPUT : totalHours, cusNum, name, electUsage
	PROCESSING STEPS : calculate owingAmount 
	                   if electUsage > 200
					   owingAmount = 200*11+(electUsage-200)*8
					   else
					   owingAmount = electUsage*11
	OUTPUTS : totalHours, cusNum, name, electUsage and owingAmount
	=================================
	PSEUDOCODE : Initialize String name to null
	             Initialize String cusNum to null
				 Initialize double totalHours to zero
				 Initialize double electUsage to zero
				 Initialize double owingAmount to zero
				 
				 Read header record
				 Print totalHours
				 
				 DOWHILE morerecords exist
                 Read number of detail records
				 IF electUsage is geater than 200
					 owingAmount = 200*11+(electUsage-200)*8
				 ELSE
					owingAmount = electUsage*11
				 Diaplay cusNum, name, electUsage, and owingAmount
				ENDDO
				 
				 
				 
	Test Data
	  electUsage: 250
	  owingAmount: 200*11+(250-200)*8 = 2600 cents
	  
	  electUsage: 180
	  owingAmount: 180*11 = 1980 cents
